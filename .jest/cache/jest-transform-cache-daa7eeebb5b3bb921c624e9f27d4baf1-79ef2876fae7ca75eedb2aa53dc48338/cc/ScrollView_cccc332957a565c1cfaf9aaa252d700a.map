* iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollView` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. This is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\n// Public methods for ScrollView\nexport type ScrollViewImperativeMethods = $ReadOnly<{|\n  getScrollResponder: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'getScrollResponder'>,\n  getScrollableNode: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'getScrollableNode'>,\n  getInnerViewNode: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'getInnerViewNode'>,\n  getInnerViewRef: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'getInnerViewRef'>,\n  getNativeScrollRef: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'getNativeScrollRef'>,\n  scrollTo: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'scrollTo'>,\n  scrollToEnd: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'scrollToEnd'>,\n  flashScrollIndicators: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'flashScrollIndicators'>,\n  scrollResponderZoomTo: $PropertyType<ScrollView, 'scrollResponderZoomTo'>,\n  scrollResponderScrollNativeHandleToKeyboard: $PropertyType<\n    ScrollView,\n    'scrollResponderScrollNativeHandleToKeyboard',\n  >,\n|}>;\n\nexport type DecelerationRateType = 'fast' | 'normal' | number;\nexport type ScrollResponderType = ScrollViewImperativeMethods;\n\ntype NativeScrollViewInstance = React.ElementRef<HostComponent<mixed>>;\ntype PublicScrollViewInstance = $ReadOnly<{|\n  ...$Exact<NativeScrollViewInstance>,\n  ...ScrollViewImperativeMethods,\n|}>;\n\ntype InnerViewInstance = React.ElementRef<typeof View>;\n\ntype IOSProps = $ReadOnly<{|\n  /**\n   * Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset\n   * for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or\n   * tab bar/ toolbar.
